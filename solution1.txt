Solution 1:

Create an empty set to hold distinct elements
Loop through set 1 and for each element:
a. Check if the element is not in the distinct set
b. If it's not, add it to the distinct set
Loop through set 2 and for each element:
a. Check if the element is not in the distinct set
b. If it's not, add it to the distinct set
Sum all the elements in the distinct set and return the result as output
Algorithm in pseudocode:

function sum_of_distinct_elements(set1, set2):
    distinct_set = set()
    for element in set1:
        if element not in distinct_set:
            distinct_set.add(element)
    for element in set2:
        if element not in distinct_set:
            distinct_set.add(element)
    sum = 0
    for element in distinct_set:
        sum += element
    return sum
